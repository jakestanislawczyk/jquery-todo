# Simple jQuery To-Do

A simple Task Listing app made on jQuery 3.4.0, doing all 4 things that recruiter wanted:

1. Clicking "Add" puts on list "Task number #", where # is the number of task
2. After clicking add again, the number of tasks starts to count up
3. Pressing "Remove" deletes latest added task
4. Button "Clear", quite obvious, clears list

In another repo, called the "Fun" ver. (clever me hyhyhy), I have upgraded the same list by adding some of QoL (quality of life) elements and making overal using of todo list more intuitive and fun.
